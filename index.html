                            well as on several cross team initiatives after I stopped being her direct manager. What

                            execution. She navigates complex challenges with ease, always with a clear vision and a

                            Betina is an incredibly smart and reliable QA engineer I've had the privilege to work with

                            Betina is an incredibly smart and reliable QA engineer I've had the privilege to work with
                            on a couple of projects. She always thoroughly checked the feature from any angle,
                            prioritizing customers' experience and going above and beyond to make sure bugs won't make
                            it to the production environment. I felt so much safer knowing someone so thoughtful and
                            knowledgeable as Betina is helping us deliver high-quality solutions. Thanks to her vast
                            product experience and business knowledge she was able to answer tricky questions or
                            reproduce edge-case scenarios hard to imagine.
